It formally represent activities and objects in the orbital space environment surrounding a celestial body such as Earth. It also represents the social and technological infrastructure supporting those activities. It expresses our knowledge of these entities, the processes by which we attain that knowledge, together with requisite data and infrastructure. 

The ontology defines categories, relationships, and their instances to capture both generic and specific domain knowledge of the target universe of discourse--the SSA domain (sometimes called 'space domain'). The ontology vocabulary can serve as metadata, semantically annotating data about satellites, as well as the orbital and ground systems supporting them. Defined terms can serve as a standard vocabulary for the community, or contribute to development of (inter)national standards. The project aims for a systematic, accurate and neutral development of ontologies and terminologies that are computable.  

SSA involves past, present and predictive knowledge about the orbital and near space environment, and the processes through which we attain that knowledge and associated data. For example, objects of interest include spacecraft orbiting Earth, datasets about their orbits and motion, and information about the data sources and associated entities. Activities of interest include observation, detection, tracking and identification, as well as the prediction (and simulation) of spacecraft future trajectories. This involves collecting, processing, analyzing and disseminating data from various sources, such as ground-based sensors.  The SSA domain is therefore tentatively construed to include the orbital space and near-space environments, occurrences therein, cataloged data about these entities and associated general knowledge (e.g., scientific laws or principles of astrodynamics).  

The project aims for systematic, accurate and neutral development of these ontologies and terminologies.  

Some purposes and goals of the ontology include: 
(1) To accurately represent objects in orbit, their orbits, and SSA data, processes, actors, and infrastructure.
(2) To support safe spaceflight and space situational awareness.
(3) To provide metadata to link, search, and retrieve data and information systems. 
(4) To provide a semantic layer for databases such as space object catalogs, and information systems, annotating the contained data elements to describe their meaning.
(5) To provide a standard, neutral, widely-applicable and common vocabulary, ontology suite, and knowledge model for the global community.
(6) To develop classifications of space objects such as spacecraft, orbital debris, etc.
(7) To provide a reference model that can be extended by more specialized ontologies.
(8) To be used in academia, industry, and gov't, including university projects, agencies such as NASA, organizations in private sector, mil. projects, and international standards development. 
(9) To explore various applications of semantic technology and artificial intelligence (AI) for astronautics.
(10) To provide an ontological model that can serve as an educational tool for the target domain.

The SSAO is based on [1] \"An Ontological Architecture for Orbital Debris Data” by Robert J. Rovetto, published 6 August 2015 in Earth Science Informatics (DOI: 10.1007/s12145-015-0233-3). It, and the ontology of SSA, was discuss in [2] “Preliminaries of a Space Situational Awareness Ontology”, by R.J.Rovetto and T.S. Kelso, in Advances in Astronautical Sciences, and presented at the 26th AAS Space Flight Mechanics meeting. 

The SSAO is a living work, and is in-progress. This particular file was created circa 2013-2016. No claims to completeness are made, and all content is subject to change.

A non-exhaustive list of tasks to be completed include the following (1-7, below). Please contact the author (rrovetto@terpalum.umd.edu) if you are interested in sponsoring, formally collaborating or contributing to development toward realize the project vision.

(1) Identifiers.
All constructs in the ontology (entities, classes, properties, individuals, etc.) are being assigned (i) Identifiers, and (ii) both preferred display labels and alternative or synonymous labels in natural language for human readability. It is anticipated that identifiers will direct to descriptive webpages, or to ontology source files (e.g., OWL files) on GitHub or elsewhere. The IRI's in this particular file may not be active at the time of this application with the NASA Ontology Oriented Orrery (Dr.O'Neil, NASA MSFC).

(2) Definitions & Formalization.
All ontology constructs or terms (e.g. labels) will list associated natural language definitions, and computable definitions. Constraints, axioms and rules are will be asserted, which will support automated inference.

Note: In this file, some constructs may display more than one definition/description, or none. Metadata, and OWL Annotations Properties, will be asserted to specify the type of definition where necessary.

(3) Modeling Alternatives.
Alternative modeling approaches are being explored. For example, Object vs. Data Properties of a similar concept, reflecting modeling attributes and their quantitative values.

(4) Modularization
Portions of the ontology will be modularized into their own reusable ontologies. They can then be imported into other ontology files, such as a master SSAO owl file, or an an external ontology. This reflects a modular ontology architecture according to which the target domain is delineated into sub-domains for more efficient computation, management, and reuse.

(5) Scope & Domain Coverage.
The scope of the SSAO may change. Alternative delineations of the domain may result in a more narrow scope. All modules are intended to be interconnected for a unified and holistic representational framework for the overarching universe of discourse of the space domain.

(6) Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KRR).
It is anticipated/desired that the ontology will be implemented in more than one KRR language.

(7) Natural Languages
The current language is English, and translation into multiple languages is desired.

This includes how and from where we acquire that data and information.

It is primarily intended to ontologically represent such things as the orbits of satellites in outer space, the objects themselves (including their parts and features), how they move or behave, the physical and social infrastructure involved in observing and predicting the motion of those objects, the organizations involved, the observation and predictive activities themselves as well as the resultant data, and relevant scientific principles. A special focus is on spacecraft and orbital debris.

The scope of this ontology is that of the SSA or space domain. At the specific instance level, this encompasses the near-Earth environment and the actual phenomena therein, including particular satellites (e.g., the International Space Station, asteroids, etc.), their inter-relationships, how they interact; data about them at a particular time (and over time), and the activities generating that data, and knowledge and situational awareness of the space environment. At a generic level, this involves capturing general knowledge of the orbital and near-space environment (including phenomena therein) for any astronomical body. Combined, this yields what has been called a domain knowledge model, reference model, semantic model, knowledge graph, etc.

The scope more precisely includes the following. 
(a) observation, detection, tracking, identification, and prediction of (artificial and natural) objects, and their past, present and future position and motion in orbit. 
(b) the agents engaging in these activities of achieving actionable SSA.
(c) the infrastructure and resources agents use in SSA-relevant activities and missions, e.g., sensor networks; data processing systems; ground, launch, and space segments.
(d) Data, such as sensor data, and spacecraft telemetry data, collected from various activities and processes.
(e) Data flow processes, e.g., from sensor to spacecraft operator.
(f) Spacecraft and orbital debris, as well as their parts, properties, behaviors, etc.
(g) Events, actions, and processes occurring in orbit, e.g., collisions, spacecraft maneuvers, etc.
(h) predictions and beliefs about current or future space object positions and trajectories
(i) Concepts and scientific principles of astrodynamics, orbital dynamics, etc.

Note: Examples of ontology constructs/elements (or symbol structures) are Classes, Object Properites and Annotation Properties in Protege.

The annotation note should be presented in a way most expressive to the author to maximize comprehensibility and expression of intended meaning/purpose. In this way, this annotaiton expresses descriptive meta-level information combined with object level information, which should match with any definition of the associated label for the given construct.

This reflects a distinction between the description of the construct (the class, relation, or indvidiual), and the lexical definition of the label it is given. 

rdfs:comment and dc:description may be similar, but the idea here is to make the above distinction explicit, i.e., to show the finer detail. 

Consider this: a desription of the term 'dog' (where 'dog' is the value of, say, rdfs:label or skos:prefLabel for the given class construct) may be \"a three-lettered word that...\", whereas the definition of 'dog' may be \"a three-legged mammal that...\". 

Therefore, the display/preferred/rendered label (i.e., term) for the construct should have a meaning (definition) that matches it. The two should match--they should express similar, if not the same, intended meaning.

If, however, a label definition is not the same as this, then a definition annotation should provide a more structured definition.

It may be a relative concept, and always in relation to one or more other entities, and with respect to an observer. A central body is considered relative to a given orbital system, i.e. a specific set of bodies. The central body of our solar system is the Sun, but is the Earth of the Earth-moon system.

One way to differentiate them is by the binding forces. Therefore it will be more precise to use 'orbit' as a catch-all term, and a more specific term for the target orbits.

The broadest concept to express is that of one thing or entity revolving around another. This covers both micro and macroscopic objects (such as spacecraft and planets), as well as centers of gravity.
Note also that dictionary definitions of 'orbit' provide various senses.

Both astronautical literature (including SSA and astronomy) and the non-specialist, often use 'orbit' to mean orbits of object in outer space. This ontology work will explore formally linking context-specific terms to more precise terms that may be asserted in the ontology.

Formal definitions, at least from a philosophical perspective, are under development by the author/ontology-creator (as of approx. 2012)."""@en ,

Distinguish between at least the act of observing, the observer, and the product of the activity. The observation of the orbital environments yields a dataset about detected objects in that environment. 

More precisely, the activity of observing is enacted by a space-based or ground-based sensor (an actor). That activity yields a observation dataset, i.e., a dataset recorded by the sensor. An observation often involves measuring some phenomena. Measurements an the activity of measuring should be represented, including the quantitative elements, such as units of distance and mass (e.g., meters and grams).

The genesis of the observation itself begins with electromagnetic energy being received by a sensor, recorded as data, processed, etc. That data may then be transitted from the sensor facility to another location (and actor).

Consider also an observation as a single event, as a single detection of an object in terms of azimuth and elevation relative to the sensor making the observation (see U.S. gov publication SD505)."""@en .

Although the lexical term is often used in the spaceflight community, typcially informally, it is not necessarily recommended to denote typical meaning of artificial object in space, because the term is inherently broader and ambiguous. The intended meaning is typically more specific than the term itself, resulting in a mismatch. It does not reflect a stable ontological category. There is nothing in the term that singles out spacecraft as opposed to planets (planets are also space objects).  

If the criteria is location-based, then that meaning reflects an temporary or non-stable criterion: an object in outerspace may fall to Earth, which will no longer make it a space object. 

Solution 1: The concept of roles can be applied. Objects in outer space can be characterized as holding the Space Object Role at one time (e.g., when in Earth orbit), but not at another time (e.g., after landing on Earth's surface).

Solution 2: The concept of Space Object Contact can be used to group those objects in orbit that have been detected. 

Solution 3: Define Space Object to have no ontological (metaphysical) import.

SSA (relative to Earth) can be understood as awareness, or knowledge, of the orbital and near-Earth space environments. This involves understanding and predicting the motion of objects in that environment, how they are related to the environment, how they interact and behave, and what their characterisitcs are. This means that it is essential to understand the causal relationships among near-Earth objects, space weather, spacecraft and orbital debris. 
It can be conceived as the understanding derived from studying the near-Earth space environment (T.S. Kelso).

The SSA domain includes natural celestial bodies (e.g., near-Earth objects), space wheather phenomena, spacecraft, orbital debris, and the processed by which we observe and gain knowledge of those entities. 

An essential task of SSA is observing, detecting, tracking identifying and predicting the motion of objects in orbital space. Space surveillance is therefore important. This calls for understanding the wider orbital space environment, including the gravitational effects from various celestial bodies.

\"Knowing the state of motion of objects in orbit, and estimating where those objects will be in the future, are central elements of space situational awareness.\" (Quote from \"Space situational awareness and space traffic management standardization\" by David Finkleman\")

Achieving and maintaining SSA requires orbit determination (identifying where an object is now), orbit propagation/prediction (identifying where an object may be in the future), and assessing risk of collisions."""@en ;
